In this section we present two ways for you to access your web services easily.
The first involves making Nix generate a HTML index page on the fly, the second
involves reverse proxying.

## Method 1: Contents page

Now that we have transmission set up, we have a small problem. The web UI is
hosted on a strange port number --- how are we to remember all these ports?
There are a few ways to solve this problem. One would be to set up a reverse
proxy for every single service. We have already seen how that can be achieved.
In this section I present something much simpler. We will be creating a contents
page of sort that simply enumerates every single service in a list.

First of all, for this to even make sense, the service port numbers cannot be
hardcoded. In fact this is already the case (look at the previous section on
Transmission). In case you do not know how to make it work, you want to be doing
something like this:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/server.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
let
tranmission_port = 9091;
in
{
  ((import ./containers/transmission/default.nix) {port = tranmission_port;})
}
```

This allows the `server.nix` file to be the single source of truth regarding
port numbers. Following this, what we want to do is to specify a list of lists
`[service_name, service_port]`. Then, we will write a function to convert this
list into a single HTML page and serve that. When you forget your port numbers,
you can visit this page to find a direct link to the correct service.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/server.nix
services.httpd.virtualHosts."<NAME>".locations."/" = {
  alias = (builtins.toFile "index.html"
      ("<html><h1>Welcome. A list of services:</h1><ul>" +
       (builtins.foldl'
        (x: y:
         x + ''<li><a href="http://<SERVER IP>:${toString (builtins.elemAt y 1)}">'' +
         ''${builtins.elemAt y 0}</a></li>'')
        "" [
          ["Transmission" trans_port]
        ]
       ) + "</ul></html>"));
};
```

## Method 2: Reverse proxy

In the case that your server is public, you might not be comfortable showing
your services off to the outside world. In that case you might want to change
the port this page is served on:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/server.nix
services.httpd.virtualHosts."<NAME>".listen = [{
  ip = "*";
  port = 1234;
}];
```

Then you can set up a private hostname on your router (so this will be an
internal address like `home.lan`)[^1], and then you can hide it behind a reverse
proxy to port `1234`:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/server.nix
services.httpd.virtualHosts."home" = {
  serverAliases = ["<HOST NAME>"];
  extraConfig = ''
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:1234/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:1234/

    '';
};
```

You should then be able to visit your contents page at `<HOST NAME>` whereas
outsiders wouldn't be able to.

What a moment of serendipity! This is brilliant! Let's now combine the two
methods above to just straight up rediect people from `service.home` to
`localhost:port`!

```nix path=/etc/nixos/services/https/default.nix
{ ... }:
{
  services.httpd.virtualHosts = builtins.listToAttrs (map
      (xs: {
         name = builtins.elemAt xs 0;
         value = {
           serverAliases = ["${builtins.elemAt xs 0}.home"];
           extraConfig = ''
             ProxyRequests Off
             ProxyPreserveHost On
             ProxyPass / http://localhost:${builtins.elemAt xs 1}/
             ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:${builtins.elemAt xs 1}/
           '';
          }; [
        ["Transmission" trans_port]
       ]
       }
      )
    );
}
```

What epic wizadry! Does this convince you of the power of Nix? Now you
can visit `transmission.home` and it will redirect you to the proper site.
Furthermore, whenever you add a new service, simply append the config into the
list and it will be automatically configured!

The following is a similar idea but for `nginx` instead.
The `portMap` parameter is still the same list of pairs as above.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/services/nginx/default.nix
{ config, portMap, ... }:
{
  services.nginx= {
  enable = true;
  virtualHosts =
    let
      # Maps a list [name, port] into a config that we want
      configgen = (host: xs:
        let
          name = builtins.elemAt xs 0;
          port = toString (builtins.elemAt xs 1);
        in
        {
          name = "${name}.${host}";
          value = {
            locations."/".proxyPass = "http://localhost:${port}";
          };
        }
      );
    in
    # portMap is a list of lists of [name, port]
    # for each hostname, we generate the config for name.hostname
    (builtins.foldl'
      (x: y: x // builtins.listToAttrs (map (configgen y) portMap))
      {}
      [ "home.com" "jiaxiaodong.com" ]
    );
  };
}
```

[^1]:
    If your DNS uses `dnsmasq`, the easiest way to do this is to add
    `address/home/<IP ADDR>` to `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`. This will also resolve
    subdomains like `app.home`. Since you cannot add wildcards into the `hosts`
    file, this is really the best option.
