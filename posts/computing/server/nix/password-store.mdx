**Deprecation warning.**
See [the section on nix-sops](./nix-sops) for better secrets handling.
The reason for deprecation:

- [nix-plugins](https://github.com/shlevy/nix-plugins) uses C and not Nix, this
  can cause `nixos-rebuild` to break from incompatibility between versions (see
  [this issue](https://github.com/shlevy/nix-plugins/issues/9)).
- This way of doing things is hard to bootstrap. You cannot launch a new system
  with the following config from a blank slate, since `builtins.extraBuiltins`
  is not available until `nix-plugins` is installed, so you can only use after
  at least one rebuild.
- The secrets handled this will still be available in the nix store as
  plaintext. This is not a fault of nix-plugins but is due to my implementation
  laziness.

In this section we will implement a simple function that would retrieve secrets
from `password-store`. It might be useful to go over the section on web
services (especially [the one on git](../506)) after this so that you can sync
your `password-store` to your server.

This section is actually a copy of [this blog
post](https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/06/24/secure-declarative-key-management.html).
I will cut out the explanations as usual and make it cookbook style. It is
actually fairly easy to implement.

First you need to enable the
[nix-plugins](https://github.com/shlevy/nix-plugins) plugin. Note that you
should ensure everything here is absolutely correct before rebuilding. An error
in your `nix.conf` can make rebuilds or rollbacks impossible and may require
rebooting into an older configuration if goes sideways. For example: do not
rebuild after this stage, because we have not defined `extra-builtins.nix` yet.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
nix.extraOptions = ''
  plugin-files = ${pkgs.nix-plugins}/lib/nix/plugins
  extra-builtins-file = ${toString ./misc/extra-builtins.nix}
'';
```

Now we define `extra-builtins.nix`. It will contain all of our extra functions
that have `exec` capability.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/misc/extra-builtins.nix
{ exec, ... }:
{
  getSecret = name: exec [ ./nix-pass.sh name ];
}
```

Simple enough. So this gives us access to a function
`builtins.extraBuiltins.getSecret` that will return whatever `nix-pass.sh`
evaluates to. Now we define that script.

```bash path=/etc/nixos/misc/nix-pass.sh
#! /bin/sh

f=$(mktemp)
trap "rm $f" EXIT
su -c "pass show $1" <USER> > $f
nix-instantiate --eval --expr "builtins.readFile $f"
```

This script will log in to `<USER>`, which should be the user that has access to
the correct `password-store`. Then it retrieves the password that was supplied
as argument and returns it. Obviously before all this works, you should have set
up `password-store` and GPG.
