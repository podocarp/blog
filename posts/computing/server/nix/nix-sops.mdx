summary: "Setting up secrets storage on NixOS"

In this section we will make use of
[nix-sops](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) to handle our secrets.
They have a fairly comprehensive readme, so just follow that.

Here are some notes:

- Secrets are only provisioned if the attrset `sops.secrets.<secret>` is non
  null. Usually you achieve this by setting `sops.secrets.<secret>.owner` to a
  proper value. If the service you are launching is running as root and you
  don't need to worry about the owner, you can also simply do
  `sops.secrets.<secret> = {}` to make the secret available anyway.
- Its is recommended that you use `age` for encryption instead of `pgp` to save
  some time. I know I have a section on setting up `pgp` but it is entirely not
  worth it, I have tried.
- Contrary to what the example file wants you to believe, only YAML strings are
  accepted. If you try storing YAML arrays, it will work but you won't be able
  to pass it into Nix.

As an example on how secret provisioning is done, the readme provides a few
examples, or you can take a look at the [mediawiki config](./mediawiki).

Here is a tip for accessing secrets in containers.
The only way for containers to access the secrets is if you bind mount them.
However this can be a problem if the services in the container don't have the
right permissions.
There is a simple and declarative way to manage this, albeit it is a little
dirty.
We use `systemd-tmpfiles` to copy the file into a temp file with the right
permissions.

```nix path=example.nix
containers.example = {
  bindMounts = {
    "/var/lib/service/auth" = {
      hostPath = config.sops.secrets."example".path;
      isReadOnly = true;
    };
  };
  config = {
    systemd.tmpfiles.rules = [
      "C /tmp/authfile - - - - /var/lib/service/auth
        "z /tmp/authfile 0444 pengu users - -"
    ];
  }

  sops.secrets."example" = {};
}
```

Now your service can read from `/tmp/authfile` instead.
You might want to change the mode and owner to a more secure setting.
