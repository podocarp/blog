Prosody is a XMPP communications server. It is really easy to set up on Nix, and
after we are done we will have a voice server capable of

- file/image uploads/sharing
- group chats (public/password gated)
- voice and video chats
- ability to write your own bots

In this setup, since Prosody has a Nix module, we will opt for the Nix module
together with a Nix container instead of using Docker. This makes configuration
absolutely painless. There will also be no need for a reverse proxy since we are
not hosting a web application.

[The Nix manual has a section on
prosody](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#module-services-prosody-basic-usage).
The container is set up as follows:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/prosody/default.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  containers.prosody = {
    autoStart = true;
    ephemeral = true;
    bindMounts = {
      "/ssl" = {
        hostPath = toString <PATH TO YOUR SSL FILE LOCATION>;
        isReadOnly = true;
      };
      "/var/lib/prosody" = {
        hostPath = "/tank/local/prosody";
        isReadOnly = false;
      };
    };
  }
}
```

The bind mounts allows the server state to persist across reboots. They are not
created automatically so you will want to create the `/tank/local/prosody`
folder or it will crashloop. We can demonstrate how to generate TLS certificates
automatically later on, but now we move on to the setup of the actual server:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/prosody/default.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  ...
    config = {
      services.prosody = {
        enable = true;
        admins = [ "<ID>@<YOUR VIRTUAL HOST>" ];
        ssl.cert = "/ssl/host.cert";
        ssl.key = "/ssl/host.key";
        virtualHosts."<YOUR VIRTUAL HOST>" = {
          enabled = true;
          domain = "<YOUR DOMAIN>";
          ssl.cert = "/ssl/host.cert";
          ssl.key = "/ssl/host.key";
        };
        muc = [ {
          domain = "conference.<DOMAIN>";
        } ];
        uploadHttp= {
          domain = "https://upload.<DOMAIN>";
        };

        modules.motd = true;
        modules.watchregistrations = true;

        extraConfig = ''
          log = "/var/lib/prosody/prosody.log"
          motd_text = [[Welcome! Type /help -a for a list of commands.]]
          '';
        package = pkgs.prosody.override {
          withCommunityModules = [ "http_upload" ];
        };
      };
    };
}
```

Be sure to edit to your own configuration. There are certain interesting things
to note:

- The virtual host is _virtual_ and so can be anything. I have given it the same
  name as my domain.
- Note that the upload domain has `https`.
- Note that MUC does not have `http`.
- Note that the virtual host domain name does not have `http`.
- The above is so because upload depends on the Prosody HTTP server. The other
  services are not performed over HTTP.
- Uploads go to `/var/lib/prosody/http_upload` by default.
- Remember to forward the right ports: 5281 for HTTPS and 5280 for
  HTTP.
- You may want to adjust `services.prosody.uploadHttp.{uploadExpireAfter,
uploadFileSizeLimit}`. See
  [here](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=21.05&show=services.prosody.uploadHttp.uploadFileSizeLimit&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&query=prosody.uploadhttp)
  for their descriptions.

At this stage you will need to create user accounts manually. To do so first we
enter the container then user `prosodyctl`:

```bash root
nixos-container root-login prosody
prosodyctl adduser <JID>
```

To allow users to create their own accounts, add the extra configuration:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/prosody/default.nix
services.prosody = {
  ...
  modules.register = true;
  extraConfig = ''
    ...
    allow_registration = true
  '';
};
```

This is disabled by default because of the possibility of getting spammed.

## SSL with Let's Encrypt

We can use ACME to request a SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. First we enable
the service together with a dummy endpoint:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/services/acme/default.nix
{ dir, ... }:
{
  security.acme = {
    email = "<YOUR EMAIL>";
    acceptTerms = true;
  };

  services.httpd.virtualHosts."root"= {
    hostName = "<YOUR DOMAIN>";
    documentRoot = dir;
  };

  systemd.tmpfiles.rules = [
    "d ${dir} 0777 root root"
  ];
}
```

Note the extra argument. This allow greater extensibility, and separation of
concern. ACME shouldn't be responsible for keeping track of which services need
certificates. Instead, the services themselves specify those details, and the
main ACME module only serves as scaffolding.

This creates an empty path `dir` where `acme` will places its challenges.
`httpd` will then serve it to `hostName`, following which `acme` will use it to
validate your domain's ownership. Next, add the following lines to request a
certificate for our prosody module:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/prosody/default.nix
{ pkgs, dir, ... }:
{
  security.acme.certs = {
    "<YOUR DOMAIN>" = {
      webroot = dir;
      email = "<YOUR EMAIL>";
      extraDomainNames = [
        "<YOUR DOMAIN>"
      ];
    };
  };
  ...
}
```

Now when you restart the service it would most likely fail to start. This is
because of permission issues from the bind mounted `ssl`. ACME creates the files
with a group that is unavailable in our container. To solve this we simply
force the groups to agree:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/prosody/default.nix
{
  ...
  users.groups.prosody.gid = 149;
  security.acme.certs.group = "prosody";
  containers.prosody.config.users.groups.prosody.gid = 149;
  containers.prosody.services.prosody.group = "prosody";
}
```

## User guide

For end users, XMPP is slightly harder to set up than other messaging services.
Below is a simple user guide you can replicate and share with your users.

### What is this?

[XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) is a protocol for instant messaging. It is a set of
rules that allow for the exchange of information between clients and servers. It
is very robust, and allows for fairly complex suite of features not limited to:

- Voice/video chat
- Bots and games
- Multi user chat
- File sharing

Your network administrator has created a XMPP server and has kindly granted you
permission to use it. This short guide serves as an onboarding document.

### Set up

Since XMPP is only a protocol, it cannot be used directly, Instead, we need a
client to be able to talk with the server and start chatting with others. There
is a big list of clients [here](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html), but
this guide will use [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) since it is fairly popular and
works on Linux and Windows.

1. Install Gajim. On Linux check your package managers. Launch Gajim.
2. You will be prompted to add an user. Add an user.
   - If your administrator has provided you with credentials, use those. Your
     username should look something like `abc@xyz.com`.
   - If you do not have credentials, click "sign up". In this case your
     administrator should have provided you with the server name. Input that.
     - If your administrator has specified a domain name or port number, tick
       "advanced settings" and set them in the next menu.
     - Otherwise, proceed.
   - Provide a username and password and you are done.
   - If you are unable to sign up, speak to your administrator. Tell him to
     enable `allow_registration`.
3. Now that you are signed in, we will want to chat.
   1. Ask your friend for their ID. This is the full path including the `@`
      portion.
   2. Go to `Accounts > "your@account.com" > Add Contact`.
   3. Enter their ID under "XMPP Address" and add the contact.
   4. Once your friend accepts your friend request you're all set.

There are some helpful plugins that might enhance your experience. Visit `Gajim > Plugins > Available`.
You might want to click these:

- Url image preview
- Clients icons
- Clickable Nicknames
- Source Code Syntax Highlight
  and press "Install/Update"

If Url image preview does not work, you might have to go to the plugin settings
(click the cog in the plugin menu) and turn on "Preview all Image URLs" and turn
off "HTTPS Verification".

If syntax highlighting does not work you might need to `pip install pygments`.
For Nix users, you can try something like this (the following is for home
manager):

```nix path=~/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [
  (self: super: {
    gajim = super.gajim.override {
      extraPythonPackages = ps: with ps; [ pygments ];
    };
  })
];
```

Some other configs you might want to enable to make life more comfy (these are
under `Gajim > Preferences`):

- General > Window Layout > Single window for everything
- Chats > Message Receipts
