NixOS makes the configuration of networks so easy it's magical. We cover a few
use cases here.

The motherboard I use came with two NICs. I will configure one `eth0` to face
the Internet and `eth1` to face the home network. This is useful in the future
to prevent things like file transfers in the home network kneecapping Internet
facing services like web servers.

The general advice is to have the two NICs on two subnets. To segregate it more,
I have set up two separate VLANs on the router for them. One benefit of doing
this is that you do not have to fiddle with DHCP settings to configure subnets.
`eth0` will be on the `192.168.0.0/24` subnet and `eth1` will be on
`192.168.1.0/24`.

Another thing we need to set-up is routing. We want all home network traffic
(destination `192.168.1.0/24`) to go through `eth1` and all Internet traffic
(destination `0.0.0.0/0`) to go through `eth0`. While we're at it, we also need to
disable DHCP on `eth1`, because my router's DHCP advertises the gateway for the
home network. Of course you need to set up a static lease on your router as
well.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
networking = {
  interfaces.eth0 = {
    useDHCP = true;
    ipv4.routes = [
    {
      address = "0.0.0.0";
      prefixLength = 0;
      via = "<GATEWAY IP>";
      options = {
        dev = "eth0";
      };
    }
    ];
  };

  interfaces.eth1 = {
    ipv4.addresses = [
    {
      address = "<STATIC LEASE IP>";
      prefixLength = 24;
    }
    ];
    ipv4.routes = [
    {
      address = "192.168.1.0";
      prefixLength = 24;
      options = {
        dev = "eth1";
      };
    }
    ];
  };
};
```

To be absolutely sure it works, plug out `eth0` and check that Internet is
disabled on the server but you should still be able to contact it from the home
network. Do the same for `eth1` but with roles reversed. Or you can check `route
-n` or something like that.
