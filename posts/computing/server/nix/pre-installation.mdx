This section covers things you need to do before installation. This is done on
the machine you are going to be administering the server from. As mentioned on
the index page I assume you are running NixOS (and Home Manager as well) on it.
It is very easy to search up how to do these things if you are not part of this
secret club.

## GPG

We will need GPG for a couple of things. One of them is because we want a
central place to manage our keys. This comes in handy when we involve other
things like `pass` later on. This is extremely simple with Home Manager:

```nix path=~/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix
services.gpg-agent = {
  enable = true;
  enableSshSupport = true;
  pinentryFlavor = "gtk2";
};
```

You can swap the pinentry to whatever you like, but in a graphical environment,
I think `gtk2` is good.

After this you obviously want to create a GPG key. Try this guide: [fedora
docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/create-gpg-keys/#creating-gpg-keys-cli).
You might also wish to search up how to backup your keys safely at this point.

## SSH

Next we want GPG to manage our SSH keys. First, we have to direct SSH over to
the GPG agent:

```nix path=~/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix
programs.bash.sessionVariables = {
  GPG_TTY = "$(tty)";
  SSH_AUTH_SOCK = "$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)";
};
```

The simplest thing to do after this is to just log out. Otherwise you can try
`source ~/.profile` and `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent`.

Next, we generate the SSH key. Execute the following:

```bash user
gpg2 --expert --edit-key <KEY ID>
```

where `<KEY ID>` is the name of the key you created just now. You want a
RSA (set your own capabilities) --- authenticate key of 2048 bits. Just follow
the prompts and you'll be through. Be sure to `quit` and not `Ctrl-C` out of the
`gpg` prompt! Finally you want to do

```bash user
gpg2 --with-keygrip --list-keys
```

and find the key that you just made. If you do not have any pre-existing keys,
it will be the only `rsa2048` key you see. Copy the keygrip (the stuff after the
`=` sign) and do

```bash user
echo <KEYGRIP> > ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol
```

Now try `ssh-add -l`, and you should see your key here.

All that is left is to transfer this key to the server. There are many ways of
doing this, the most primitive and easiest being just using a usb stick.

Actually to save trouble you don't need to do this before you install Nix on the
server. When booting from the liveCD, all you need to do to enable SSH access is
to set a root password. Furthermore you will be wasting some effort since you
might need to re-copy the keys after the installation is performed.
