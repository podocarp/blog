This page will document how to set up a Tinode chat server and place it behind
an Apache reverse proxy. This serves as an example for a pattern that will be
repeated through the rest of this section on hosting web services.

We will follow their very convenient guide on setting up Tinode in docker (see
[readme](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/docker/README.md)). We need
to start two docker containers, one containing the database and another
containing the server.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/tinode/default.nix
{
  virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."tinode-mysql" = {
    autoStart = true;
    image = "mysql:5.7";
    environment = {
      MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD = "yes";
    };
    extraOptions = [ "--network=tinode-net" "--name=mysql" ];
  };

  virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."tinode-srv" = {
    autoStart = true;
    image = "tinode/tinode-mysql:latest";
    ports = [ "6060:6060" ];
    extraOptions = [ "--network=tinode-net" ];
  };
}
```

These are translated directly from the readme and its the bare minimum you need
to get the server up.

Notice the `network` flag. The two containers communicate through a bridge. We
set up a dirty systemd service to spawn this bridge:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/tinode/default.nix
systemd.services.tinode-net = {
  description = "Brings up docker bridge tinode-net";
  after = [ "network.target" ];
  serviceConfig.Type = "oneshot";
  script =
    ''
    ${pkgs.docker}/bin/docker network create tinode-net 2&> /dev/null
    '';
};
```

This will get you far enough. However, any changes made to the chat server (for
example user registration, messages, etc.) are not persistent across reboots.
This is because the images are deleted after they are stopped, so the database
vanishes. To solve this, we use docker volumes. Since we have a nice big
filesystem, this also solves the problem of backups. For example:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/tinode/default.nix
virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."tinode-mysql" = { # ...
  volumes = [
    "/var/log/mysql:/var/log"
      "/tank/public/tinode/mysql:/var/lib/mysql"
  ];
}
virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."tinode-srv" = { # ...
  volumes =
    [
    "/tank/public/tinode/uploads:/uploads"
      "/var/log/tinode:/var/log"
    ];
}
```

Note the mapping is `<host>:<container>`. This also allows us to expose the logs
to the host system. Now we can do `tail --follow /var/log/tinode/tinode.log` for
instance.

You may also want to change some settings. For example the default minimum username length is 3, and there is no TLS enabled. You could change these by mounting your `tinode.conf` as a volume:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/tinode/default.nix
virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."tinode-srv" = {
    # ...

    volumes =
          let
            conf = ./tinode.conf;
          in
          [
            "${conf}:/tinode.conf"
            # ...
          ];
        environment = {
          EXT_CONFIG = "/tinode.conf";
        };
}
```

Nix also resolves relative paths to absolute paths upon evaluation. Also, do
note that if `tinode.conf` contains important keys. Read the comments in the
template file given in the tinode repository and don't share it with others!

## Apache reverse proxy

We will use Apache `httpd` to set up a reverse proxy now. This has a few
benefits:

- This is an elegant way of exposing services as subdomains rather than having
  to remember a port number for each.
- This also means that our firewall only needs to open ports 80 and 443.
- We can also ask `httpd` to handle TLS for us instead of relying on the
  individual services.
  ```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/tinode/default.nix
  services.httpd.virtualHosts."chat"= {
    hostName = "<YOUR FRIENDLY CANONICAL URL HERE>";
    addSSL = true;
    sslServerCert = <PATH TO CERT>;
    sslServerKey = <PATH TO KEY>;
    extraConfig = ''
      ProxyRequests Off
      ProxyPreserveHost On
      ProxyPass / http://localhost:6060/
      ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:6060/
      '';
  };
  ```
  ```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  services.httpd = {
    enable = true;
    adminAddr = "<YOUR EMAIL>";
    extraModules = [
      "proxy"
        "proxy_http"
    ];
  };
  ```

Now you will be able to access tinode at whatever URL you put in. However you
might note that you receive connection errors. This is because tinode uses
websockets which are not passed through by the proxy. Insert the following
lines to let websockets through:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/tinode/default.nix
extraCofig = '' # ...
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP:UPGRADE} ^WebSocket$ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:CONNECTION} ^Upgrade$ [NC]
RewriteRule .\* ws://localhost:6060%{REQUEST_URI} [P]
''
```

I have not tested if the following is necessary, I don't think it is, but it
doesn't hurt to include it.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
extraModules = [
# ...
"proxy_wstunnel"
]
```

## Summary

There is some room for improvement here. If you have played with this you may
notice how docker makes a pig breakfast out of your firewall. This is because
both Nix and docker use `iptables`, so there are some conflicts there.
Apparently podman does not do this so consider switching. However docker was
used simply because tinode quite conveniently supplies their own images.
