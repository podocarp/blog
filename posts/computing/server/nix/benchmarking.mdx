In this section we cover how to benchmark your server.

## Network

To benchmark the network connection between your server and another (Linux)
device is simple. You will want the `iperf` tool. This is as simple as `nix-env
-iA nixos.iperf`. You also want to open an unused port in your firewall. You
cannot get by this, Nix is very strict on firewalls. There is also an UDP option
(`s/TCP/UDP`).

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8080 ];
```

Now on the server

```bash
~$ iperf -s -p 8080

---

## Server listening on 8080

```

On the client

```bash
~$ iperf -c <SERVER IP> -p 8080
[ 5] local 192.168.0.1 port 39936 connected to 192.168.0.2 port 8080
[ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr Cwnd
[ 5] 0.00-1.00 sec 11.3 MBytes 94.4 Mbits/sec 0 180 KBytes
...
```

Fairly good. I pretty much saturate the 100M switch I have, so not much else I can
do besides spending more money.

## Disk

The thing to note here is to never run anything as root, and double check target
directories when you are testing on disks lest you wipe something important! To
be safe create a new dataset/partition away from actual data!

### dd

This is the simplest. This writes 400M of random data.

```bash user=1
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/nfs/temp bs=4M count=100k
...
419430400 bytes (419 MB, 400 MiB) copied, 7.03854 s, 59.6 MB/s
```

On a remote client the speed is basically bottlenecked by the network link.

```bash user=1
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/nfs/temp bs=4M count=100k
...
419430400 bytes (419 MB, 400 MiB) copied, 46.1586 s, 9.1 MB/s
```

### Bonnie++

Bonnie++ is a free benchmarking tool released under the GPLv2. It can be handy
for testing things other than just throughput, such as CPU usage etc.
Installation is as simple as `nix-env -iA nixos.bonnie`. All you need to do
is to specify a directory.

```bash user=1
bonnie++ -d /nfs/temp
```

Now by default it will try to write a file that is twice the size of your RAM
(of the machine running the tool, not the machine with the disks). This is to
negate any effects of caching, but if it is a bit insane then just disable the
checks. Here I tell the tool to test with 1024M instead.

```bash user=1
bonnie++ -d /nfs/temp -s 1024 -r 0
...

If the txt output isn't very nice on the eyes, you can copy the last line and
pipe it through `bon_csv2html` and open it in a browser instead.
