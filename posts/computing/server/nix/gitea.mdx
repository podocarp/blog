## Git

Part of my goals is to set up a git server. This is actually quite useful.
This git server will back up a `password-store` repository, and later on it will
be used to host a wiki (Gollum). First is just a barebones set-up

We create a new home directory for a new git user:

```bash root
zfs create tank/git
```

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
users.users.git = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  home = "/tank/git";
  openssh.autorizedKeys.keys = [ <SSH KEY HERE> ];
};
```

Then, `ssh` into the new `git` user and we create a new repository

```bash user
mkdir <repo>.git
cd <repo>.git; git init --bare
```

In case you have an actual git repository somewhere else,

```bash user
git remote set-url origin git@<SERVER ADDRESS>:<repo>.git
git push
```

## Gitea

The previous section allowed you to set up git repositories manually. However,
what if we wanted to have a nice frontend instead? This is where we enter
[Gitea](https://gitea.com/).

```nix path=/etc/nixos/containers/gitea/default.nix
{ config, port, sshPort, ... }:
{
  containers.gitea = {
    autoStart = true;
    ephemeral = true;
    bindMounts = {
      "/var/lib/gitea" = {
        hostPath = "/tank/local/gitea";
        isReadOnly = false;
      };
    };

    config = {
      services.gitea = {
        enable = true;
        domain = "<DOMAIN>";
        rootUrl = "https://<DOMAIN>";
        httpPort = port;
        ssh.clonePort = sshPort;

        settings = {
          server = {
            START_SSH_SERVER = true;
            SSH_DOMAIN = "ssh.%(DOMAIN)s";
            LANDING_PAGE = "login";
          };
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

There are a ton of [settings you can
tweak](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet/#repository-repository).
Regarding our configuration, here are some pointers:

- ssh needs its own port because we are in a container. The ssh traffic would
  never reach the container if we used the system ssh port.
- Apache cannot reverse proxy ssh traffic. This means we would have to open the
  ssh port in our firewall.
- You can try to do some funny port forwarding tricks to get the ssh traffic to
  pass through port 443 together with https. However due to the way port
  forwarding work on `systemd-nspawn` (namely, [it ignores the loopback
  device](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6106)), I have given up on
  this.
