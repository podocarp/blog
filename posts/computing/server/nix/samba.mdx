## NFS

After going through setting up our RAID array we want to create a network shared
dataset using NFS. This is fairly easy. First enable NFS server support

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
services.nfs.server.enable = true;
```

Import the pool if you haven't done so already. Next,

```bash root
zfs create -o sharenfs=rw=192.168.0.0/24 tank/public
zfs share -a
```

OpenZFS (what we are using) has fewer options than Oracle ZFS. The only one
pertaining to us is `rw=192.168.0.0/24`. This will restrict `rw` access to
clients on the provided subnet. You can also try `ro` with a smaller subnet to
restrict write permissions. The last command shares all datasets. Try executing

```bash root
exportfs -rv
```

to see that your dataset is shared.

On the client system,

```nix path=/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
fileSystems."<NFS PATH>" = {
device = "<SERVER IP>:/tank/public";
fsType = "nfs";
};
```

Right out of the box you might meet some permission issues. You can try to
`chown` the pool such that both sides agree on permissions. If you couldn't care
less, `chmod 777`.

## Samba

If you want to share to a Windows device you will have to use Samba. The ZFS
`sharesmb` option does not work for me. Setting up Samba independently is easy
enough though:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.smbclient ];
services.samba = {
  enable = true;
  securityType = "user";
  shares.<NAME> = {
    path = "/tank/public";
    writeable = "yes";
    browseable = "yes";
  };
  shares.global = {
    "server min protocol" = "SMB2_02";
  };
};
```

Next, for every user that needs access, create a user

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
users.users.<USER> = {
  createHome = false;
  shell = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/nologin";
};
```

on your server and then issue `smbpasswd -a <USER>`. Set the password and issue
this to your user. From Windows your user would be able to log in with these
credentials to `\\<SERVER IP>\<NAME>`.

## NFS and Samba

This is not recommended if your share gets large. In a home situation, it is
still very acceptable. Only proceed if you understand the implications and
shortcomings of this set-up (mainly cross protocol conflicts) and can live with
them

Since we are at home, we can just assume that everyone is friendly and give RW
access to a single user. Create a new user for this purpose:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
users.users.fileshare = {
  createHome = false;
  shell = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/nologin";
  group = "fileshare";
  uid = 42069;
};
users.groups.fileshare.gid = 42069;
```

The `uid` and `gid` defaults used by NFS are 65534. This might be the
`nobody:nobody` user and group but to be sure we explicitly create an user. Now

```bash root
zfs set sharenfs=rw=192.168.1.0/24,all_squash,anonuid=42069,anongid=42069 tank
```

Now every user will be mapped to `fileshare:fileshare` when writing through NFS.
Now to sort out Samba, run `smbpasswd -a fileshare` and set a password. You
should now be good to go!

## Snapshots

It is simple to enable automatic snapshots.

```bash root
zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot=true tank
```

The following makes daily snapshots and keeps a week's worth. Change depending
on your usage intensity.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
services.zfs.autoSnapshot = {
  enable = true;
  frequent = 0;
  hourly = 0;
  daily = 7;
  weekly = 1;
  monthly = 0;
};
```
