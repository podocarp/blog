So far our deployment has been manual.
Unless you are doing something special, it would have been like this

1. SSH into your machine
2. Edit the config files there, usually `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
3. Run `nixos-rebuild switch` on the machine.
4. Logout.

Now this feels rather suboptimal, since

- what if I don't want to edit the config files through SSH, probably on the
  command line,
- what if I also don't want to run something like syncthing or keep having to
  `git pull`,
- what if I don't even want to manually SSH in and then run the rebuild command,
- what if my server is trash, like a raspberry pi, and it takes ages to rebuild.

That is why there is `NixOps`.
NixOps has a lot of functionalities, from being able to provision VMs for you,
to pushing to cloud services.
For us, we are interested in its ability to deploy to other Nix machines, **as
long as** you can SSH into the root user on that machine.

## Before we start

As of writing!
The latest version of NixOps is actually v2, which is still in pre-release.
However by default you install the v1.7 version.
Now they have stopped patching v1.7 to work on v2, and if you install v1.7, you
will receive a scary warning about some security vulnerability. So, it is
suggested that you install `nixops_unstable`.

## Getting started

First create a file like this:

```nix path=ops/nixops.nix
{
  network = {
    description = "Server";
    enableRollback = true;
    storage.legacy = {
      databasefile = "~/.nixops/deployments.nixops";
    };
  };

  defaults = {
    imports = [ <PATH TO SERVER CONFIG> ];
  };

  machine = { ... }:
  {
    deployment.targetHost = "<IP OF SERVER>";
  };
}
```

Of course you can just dump your entire server's `configuration.nix` into the
`defaults` field, but it is much better to keep it in a separate file and import
it.

Now run

```bash user
nixops create -d <ALIAS>
```

where `<ALIAS>` is a name you want to give to this deployment for referencing,
for example `server`. You should also do this in the directory with the
`nixops.nix` file, or, supply that directory with the `--network` argument.

Now you can list the deployments and will see something similar:

```bash user=1
nixops list
+--------------------------------------+--------+-------------+------------+------+
| UUID | Name | Description | # Machines | Type |
+--------------------------------------+--------+-------------+------------+------+
| ce792a83-35c6-11ed-96a3-6c02e03edf9a | server | Server | 1 | none |
+--------------------------------------+--------+-------------+------------+------+
```

Then,

```bash user=1
nixops deploy
... a whole bunch of build output ...
machine> activation finished successfully
server> deployment finished successfully
```

## Notes

- Since the deployment is built locally, the `nixpkgs` version used will most
  likely be that used by your system. You can specify a path to a local copy of
  `nixpkgs` with the `-I` argument, or pin it with a git checkout in the server
  configuration file if you want to use a fixed version.
- I think NixOps deploys to the root user and I am not sure how to change it to
  for example a user in `@wheel`. So you need to open SSH access for the root
  user.
- You can test the deployment on a VM first -- swap out `deploment.targetHost`
  to `deployment.targetEnv = "virtualbox";`.
