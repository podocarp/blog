This section will cover a few system-level configurations you can make to
improve performance.

## Nix storage optimisations

You may find that Nix uses quite a large amount of storage space. This is simply
how it works. See [garbage
collection](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sec-garbage-collection).

This enables automatic garbage collection. One may change the `options` to
`--delete-old` to delete everything other than the current generation.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
nix.gc = {
automatic = true;
dates = "weekly";
options = "--delete-older-than 7d";
};
```

The next optimisation is to replace identical files in the store with hard
links. There is no need to run this very often.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
nix.optimise = {
automatic = true;
dates = [ "weekly" ];
};
```

## Power optimisations

Below are a few optimisations. Perhaps the biggest one is to enable powertop's
automatic configuration. A good resource is the [Arch wiki on power management](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management).

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
boot.kernel.sysctl = {
  "kernel.nmi_watchdog" = 0;
  "vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs" = 6000;
  "vm.laptop_mode" = 5;
};

powerManagement = {
  powertop.enable = true;
  scsiLinkPolicy = "med_power_with_dipm";
};
```

If you want your disks to spin down, you can also configure `hdparm`:

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
powerManagement.powerUpCommands = ''
${pkgs.hdparm}/sbin/hdparm -S 242 /dev/sda
${pkgs.hdparm}/sbin/hdparm -S 242 /dev/sdb
${pkgs.hdparm}/sbin/hdparm -S 242 /dev/sdc
'';

# etc.
```

The value 242 is actually a full hour. You may want to visit `man hdparm`
regarding how this value is calculated.
