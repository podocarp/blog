We will assume a working internet connection on the server. If you do not have
internet, you cannot run Nix (the package manager).

We will be be running ZFS as our filesystem. Built-in snapshotting, compression,
encryption are some of its boons. Therefore read some of the warnings on the
[NixOS wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ZFS) first. If it doesn't suit
you, running ext4 is very easy, you can just follow the Nix manual
(`nixos-help`).

## ZFS

### Partitioning

I separate my disks into two classes. I have a SSD that I will use to hold the
`/boot` and `/` partitions. I then have a few other drives that I will set up
RAIDZ on to hold other data. I will not recommend you mixing these two.

There are two choices now for your non-root disks. The first choice is to create
an empty GPT partition on every disk that spans the whole disk, and give every
partition a good label. The [Arch
wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ZFS#Using_GPT_labels) gives some
justification on why this is a good idea. It is fairly straightforward with
`gdisk`. After this you can check that you did it right like so

```bash user=1
ls -la /dev/disk/by-partlabel/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Mar 16 14:08 ssd -> ../../nvme0n1p1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 16 14:14 sea-1 -> ../../sdb1
...
```

If you can't be bothered, just refer to the disks by the paths in this folder

```bash user=1
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Mar 16 14:34 ata-ST4XXX -> ../../sdb
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Mar 16 14:34 nvme-euXXX -> ../../nvme0n1
...
```

This might be easier for now because you do not need to worry about partition
alignment and all that. Furthermore ZFS encourages one to allocate entire disks
to it and not partitions.

For the root disk we will create three partitions, one for the EFI partition,
one for ZFS, and another for swap space. One may choose to set up EFI and swap
on ZFS, but it is not worth the hassle. While we're at it, please assign the
partitions some sensible labels. The partition table will look something like
this:

```text
Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048          206847   100.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2          206848      1929586687   920.0 GiB   BF00  zroot
   3      1929586688      1953525134   11.4 GiB    8200  swap
```

Resize the partitions as you wish. We also do not need more than one
partition for ZFS. We can separate the `/home` and `/` partitions on ZFS without
doing any manual partitioning. After this we can use the partitions (change the
disk labels to your own):

```bash root
mkfs.vfat /dev/disk/by-partlabel/EFI
mkswap /dev/disk/by-partlabel/swap
swapon /dev/disk/by-partlabel/swap
```

We will mount the ZFS partition in the following section after some set-up. Also
the EFI partition is not mounted for the same reason.

### Zpool creation

Storage is congregated into zpools in ZFS. They can span logical devices, or
just be a single partition, there is great freedom here.

First we should check the sector size:

```bash user=1,3
blockdev --getpbsz /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ssd
512
blockdev --getpbsz /dev/disk/by-partlabel/sea-1
4096
```

As you can see my two disks report different sector sizes. For 512 and 4096 we
want to specify `ashift=12` later on. For larger drives you may encounter 8096
sector sizes and you will want `ashift=13` instead. The [OpenZFS
documentation](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Performance%20and%20Tuning/Workload%20Tuning.html?highlight=ashift#alignment-shift-ashift)
talks about the reasoning behind this.

Now create the root pool.

```bash root=1
zpool create \
 -o ashift=12 \
 -O xattr=sa \
 -O acltype=posixacl \
 -O atime=off\
 -O compression=lz4 \
 -O mountpoint=none \
 -O normalization=formD \
 -R /mnt \
 zroot /dev/disk/by-partlabel/zroot
```

The following is an elaboration on the options (`-o` is for the pool and `-O` is
for filesystems).

- `ashift` has been mentioned above.
- `xattr` and `acltype` is needed and recommended for `systemd-journald`. See
  Nix wiki.
- `atime=off` disables access time logging. Grants a performance boost.
- `compression=lz4` enables compression using `lz4`, grants a performance boost.
- `mountpoint=none` disables automount as we want to use `fstab` for
  auto-mounting by NixOS.
- `normalization=formD` is a recommended setting controlling UTF-8
  normalization.
- `-R /mnt` mounts the pool at `/mnt` after the command as a _temporary_ mount
  point.

### Dataset creation

Datasets are to ZFS what partitions are to other filesystems. The Nix wiki
recommends a hierarchy like this:

```text
- zroot
  - local
    - local/home
    - local/root
  - nix
    - nix/nix
```

This adds some separation of concerns. For instance, we will encrypt the entire
`local` but there is little need to encrypt `nix`. There is no need to backup
any NixOS stuff, so we will only back up the `local` dataset, or even more
efficiently, backup only `local/home` and the NixOS configuration file. More on
that later.

Create the dataset for nix stuff.

```bash root
zfs create -o mountpoint=none zroot/nix
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy zroot/nix/nix
```

- `mountpoint=none` disables mounting and `mountpoint=legacy` allows us to mount
  the dataset using `mount`. Otherwise you will have to use `zfs mount`. Again,
  this is to allow us to manage the mounts with `fstab` which Nix will generate.

Create the dataset for the root partition. We enable encryption here and all
children will inherit this property. If you do not want this then encrypt the
children separately.

```bash root=1,7,8
zfs create \
 -o mountpoint=none \
 -o encryption=aes-128-gcm \
 -o keyformat=passphrase \
 -o keylocation=prompt \
 zroot/local
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy zroot/local/root
zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy zroot/local/home
```

- `encryption` enables encryption. We explicitly specify `aes-128-gcm`
  algorithm to be used. One may refer to
  [stackexchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6842/how-to-choose-between-aes-ccm-and-aes-gcm-for-storage-volume-encryption)
  on a brief comparison between the two algorithms available. Furthermore 128
  bits is generally sufficient for home use, otherwise feel free to use 256 bits
  instead.
- `keyformat` and `keylocation` specifies how ZFS obtains the encryption key
  (password). Our settings means that ZFS will just ask you for a password
  prompt. However it is much more robust to hold the keyfile in some removable
  media simply because entering into a prompt might not be feasible at times.

In the future you might notice that the encryption key remains in memory. To
completely unmount a drive, you want to do

```bash root
zfs unmount <ENCRYPTED DISK>
zfs unload-key <ENCRYPTED DISK>
```

As a sanity check run

```bash root
zpool export zroot
zpool import -d /dev/disk/by-id zroot
zfs load-key zroot/local
zfs list
```

This unmounts the disks, then searches all devices (`-d`) for `zroot` and
imports it. If you encounter a permission error it might be that you forgot to
unlock an encrypted dataset, see `zfs load-key` above.

Next we do the actual mounting. This is fairly simple.

```bash root
mount -t zfs zroot/local/root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/{nix,home,boot}
mount -t zfs zroot/local/home /mnt/home
mount -t zfs zroot/nix/nix /mnt/nix
mount /dev/disk/by-partlabel/EFI /mnt/boot
```

For more comprehensive docs, of course refer to the [Oracle
documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54801/gayok.html).

### RAIDZ

We also want to create a pool of large mechanical disks and set them up in
RAIDZ2. When choosing a RAID strategy, one must evaluate the
value of data against efficiency and speed. It is a balancing act between these
three attributes. RAIDZ2 is a good equilibrium for me, since double parity
drastically lowers the chance of failures since any two disks can fail (compare
with RAID0 or RAIDZ1). Furthermore it is more efficient, by using only two disks
for parity (compare with mirroring which uses half the number of disks).
Performance is also not really a consideration.

In any case, it is set-up very similar to how we set-up the root partition:

```bash root=1
zpool create \
 -o ashift=12 \
 -O atime=off\
 -O compression=lz4 \
 -O mountpoint=/tank \
 -O normalization=formD \
 tank raidz2 \
 ata-6Z \
 ata-D8 \
 ata-WB \
 ata-R1 \
 ata-QW \
 ata-SW
```

The `mountpoint` is no longer `legacy` since we cannot `zfs share` a dataset
mounted as legacy. To have it mount on boot, include the following

```nixos path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
boot.zfs.extraPools = [ "tank" ];
boot.zfs.forceImportAll = false;
```

Note that if you have any encrypted datasets this might block startup depending
on how your key is set up! Actually as long as your root filesystem is encrypted
then it is not too big of a problem to leave the key for `tank` in the root file
filesystem. Or see one of the solutions below: [removable encryption
key](#removable-encryption-key).

You will also have to replace the drive IDs (the `ata-xxx` entries) with yours;
run `ls -l /dev/disk/by-id` to find yours.

If you are going to consider putting more than one dataset on the array, then it
is recommended to enable encryption for them separately instead of globally
here. You will find yourself stuck later on if you suddenly have the need to
create an unencrypted dataset on this array. To enable encryption you will
perform the same steps as detailed above.

## NixOS installation

Now we are ready to install the system. Make sure you have mounted everything!

```bash root
nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
```

Below is a minimal configuration file to get you started. It can be used as a
drop-in replacement for the generated file, though you need to modify some
settings.

```nix path=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix lineno
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ];

  boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "zfs" ];
  # If you have any encrypted datasets enable this:
  boot.zfs.requestEncryptionCredentials = true;

  # Use the GRUB 2 boot loader.
  boot.loader.grub = {
    enable = true;
    version = 2;
    efiSupport = true;
    device = "nodev";
  };

  # Define your hostname.
  networking.hostName = "localhost";

  # Set to your timezone
  time.timeZone = "UTC";

  # This will be deprecated soon. See comments in config file.
  networking.useDHCP = true;
  # ZFS requires this setting
  networking.hostId = "<random 8-digit hex string>";

  # Define a user account. Don't forget to set a password with ‘passwd’.
  users.users.username = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    extraGroups = [ "wheel" ]; # Enable ‘sudo’ for the user.
  };

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    wget
    vim
    tmux
    git
    pciutils # for lspci
  ];

  security.sudo = {
    enable = true;
    wheelNeedsPassword = false;
  };

  # Enable the OpenSSH daemon.
  services.openssh.enable = true;

  system.stateVersion = "20.09";
}
```

You might want to check `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix` and see if
everything is alright there. If all is well, execute

```bash root
nixos-install
```

and reboot.

## Optional steps

### Removable encryption key

If you have encrypted your root dataset then upon reboot you will be greeted by
a prompt for the password. This can be very inconvenient at times, because:

- there is nobody nearby to enter the password, or
- the password is intentionally long and complex, or
- the server has no input devices or display.

Now what you want is to have some kind of removable drive you insert in before
booting and take out after startup. You would keep this safe at some separate
place. There is a very simple way to implement this system. We will improvise on
this [github comment](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/6556#issuecomment-497010957).
Actually the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_Arch_Linux_on_ZFS#Loading_password_from_USB-Stick)
also provides a similar solution, but their solution destroys the removable
disk (you cannot store other things on it anymore).

Here lies the trick. Since the key is retrieved using `getline()`, it will stop
after encountering the first newline character. Thus we can write our key into
any partition, as long as we end it off with a newline. So first, create a small
partition with `fdisk`. Here is output from my `fdisk`. You will want to give it
a good label too, I called mine `key`.

```text
Device     Start      End  Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sdc1   2048     2049        2    1K Microsoft basic data
/dev/sdc2   4096 30629342 30625247 14.6G Microsoft basic data
```

Now `/dev/sdc2` can be used for whatever you like, and we will store the key on
`/dev/sdc1`. Execute the following:

```bash root
dd if=<(echo -e "<YOUR KEY HERE>\n") of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/key
```

The key is simply stored as plaintext on the small partition. At the end of the
day, regardless of how you obfuscate this, if you let someone steal your keys
then they can unlock your gate.

Now, we modify the dataset in question to change where it sources its key from:

```bash root
zfs change-key -o keylocation=file:///dev/disk/by-partlabel/key zroot/local
```

You can repeat the process to create a whole keychain on a USB stick. Since it
is troublesome to shift and resize partitions, I suggest just creating slots for
around ten keys or so. To do the partitioning all in one shot:

```bash path=part.sh lineno
for i in {1..10}
do
 echo ":size=1,name=key$i";
done | sfdisk /dev/sdc
```
