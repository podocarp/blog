This series of posts will cover the set-up of a server running on NixOS from a
computer running on NixOS. The fact that you are considering Nix implies that
you think you know your way around Linux. As such, this guide will be more
cookbook than textbook.

The entries in bold are more interesting things, the rest are just friends we
make along the journey.
