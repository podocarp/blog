## Problem

Latex might be great for typesetting, but when it comes to drawing, you're in
for a whole lot of pain. I still remember the days when I stupidly tried to draw
graphs out with tikz.

I was very much inspired by [this blog
post](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/), in which the author detailed
how he has some cool tricks to insert inkscape drawings directly into his Latex
documents.

I checked out his repo, but thought that his way of handling it was way too
heavy. It sets up a whole daemon to wait for events, and it also depended on
`rofi` which I don't use. Also you have to install it as a python package, and I
thought it would be better if you just did it natively in Vim.

## Solution

My solution came through the [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)
plugin. This power that this snippet engine brings is the ability to execute
python code within the snippets. All you need is literally just Ultisnips.

### The snippet

This is the preparation snippet:

```vim
priority 1000
snippet fig "Figure block preparation" w
fig $1 fig$0
endsnippet
```

All this does is to give us a unique format that is easier to parse later on.
Then what happens later is, after the user escapes from this snippet, `fig
title fig<Tab>`, the main snippet activates:

```vim
priority 10000
snippet "fig (.*) fig" "Insert figure" wr
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\def\svgwidth{${3:\linewidth}}
\import{./figures}{${1:`!p
if snip.c != "":
	pass
else:
	import os
	import re

	figureDir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "figures/")
	regex = r'\w+'
	figureName = "-".join([x.lower() for x in re.findall(regex, match.group(1))])
	figurePath = figureDir + figureName + '.svg'

	if os.path.isfile(figurePath):
		snip.rv = "File already exists!"
	else:
		import subprocess
		templatePath = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/inkscape/templates/default1024.svg")
		subprocess.call(['mkdir', '-p', figureDir])
		subprocess.check_output(['cp', templatePath, figurePath])
		subprocess.call(['inkscape', figurePath])
		snip.rv = figureName
`}.pdf_tex}
\caption{${2:caption}}
\label{fig:$1}
%edit $1 edit%
%recomp $1 recomp%
\end{figure}
$0
endsnippet
```

Let us go through step by step to see what this does.

Ultisnips actually runs each snippet multiple times to check for "convergence"
([#375](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/issues/375)). This would be a big
problem for us if we did not de-bounce, since it would cause multiple instances
of Inkscape to be spawned. Luckily, `snip.c` is populated by Ultisnips to represent the
text currently represented by this block of python. Hence we simply check if it
is not empty `snip.c != ""` before executing. I am unsure of a better way to do
it other than these ugly conditionals.

Next we just have some variable definitions, and perform a simple translation
into kebab case which is friendlier for file names. This means `hello World ` is
translated into `hello-world`.

If the file exists we just announce it and exit. This part can be customized but
generally if there is a name conflict it is easy to hit `uu`, change the name,
and `<Tab><Tab>`. I don't have a use-case for importing the same image multiple
times.

If all goes well, we will copy a default template over. This is _not_ there by
default! For me, I just created a `1024x768` blank svg and saved it at the
path shown. We use `cp` because it's lighter than `copy()`. Finally we simply
pass the file to Inkscape and wait.

### Editing and recompiling

The usual way to save an Inkscape document as something comprehensible by Latex
is through the save dialogue. Now that is way too many keystrokes. There is a
very simple way to solve this.

If you notice, in the snippet above two Latex comments were created at the
bottom of the figure:

```vim
%edit $1 edit%
%recomp $1 recomp%
```

The purpose of these two comments is to form two "hyperlinks" lying there for
future use.

Here's the two snippets involved:

```vim
snippet "%recomp (.*) recomp%" "Recompile svg" wr
%recomp `!p
if snip.c != "":
    pass
else:
    import subprocess
    figurePath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "figures/", match.group(1))
    subprocess.call(['inkscape', '--export-pdf', figurePath+'.pdf', '--export-latex', figurePath+'.svg'])
    snip.rv = match.group(1)
` recomp%$0
endsnippet

snippet "%edit (.*) edit%" "Edit svg" wr
%edit `!p
if snip.c != "":
    pass
else:
    import subprocess
    figurePath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "figures/", match.group(1) + '.svg')
    subprocess.call(['inkscape', figurePath])
    snip.rv = match.group(1)
` edit%$0
endsnippet
```

Again for both we perform our de-bouncing. Then we simply execute Inkscape with
corresponding flags, et voila! Mission accomplished.

## Advanced Features

Recompiling is just too troublesome. I want the document to reload as I update
the svg in Inkscape. Also, a separate `edit` and `compile` is too much work, and
it requires manual navigation. The snippet should be triggering the compiling
instead, and `edit` has absorb the work of the main snippet as well. We want a
unified editing interface.

Here's the changes to the main snippet:

```diff
-        subprocess.call(['inkscape', figurePath])
+        subprocess.call(['inkscape', '--export-pdf', figureDir+figureName+'.pdf', '--export-latex', figurePath])

-%edit $1 edit%
+%edit $1 edit%$4

-%recomp $1 recomp%
```

Just some simple cleaning up. Now the cursor moves to behind `edit` to prepare
to trigger our new `edit` snippet:

```vim
snippet "%edit (.*) edit%" "Edit svg" wr
%edit `!p
if snip.c != "":
    pass
else:
    import subprocess
    figureStem = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "figures/", match.group(1))
    figurePath = figureStem + '.svg'
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['inkscape', figurePath]) # open in bg

    from inotify_simple import INotify, flags
    inotify = INotify()
    inotify.add_watch(figurePath, flags.MODIFY)

    update = lambda : subprocess.call(['inkscape', '--export-pdf', figureStem+'.pdf', '--export-latex', figurePath])
    while True:
        if proc.poll() is not None:
            update()
            break	# inkscape closed
        else:
            l = inotify.read(timeout=1000)	# block and wait for inotify
            if (len(l) > 0):
                update()

    inotify.close()
    snip.rv = match.group(1)
` edit%$0
endsnippet
```

The main changes here are:

- We use `Popen` to open Inkscape in the background now;
- We use
  [`inotify_simple`](https://inotify-simple.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#introduction) to watch for changes;
- We automatically recompile after edits instead of waiting for the user.
