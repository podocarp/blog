Day 38, 25 Dec 17

Nice, it's Christmas.
Didn't sleep well last night
Obviously, because I was lying under some bush getting destroyed by insects.
Wonder how hobos survive?

Tried going to the toilet, my legs wouldn't even bring me that far.
Decided that it wasn't worth forcing it.
Normally I would start quoting some great motivational quotes but no, the price is too great.
To aggravate this injury would cost me a great deal in the future, especially as I have been ignoring it for like a month and that it was always getting worse.

There was no doctor or pharmacy nearby because I was kind of in the middle of nowhere, and there were no towns or anything further down the trail so I had to fast forward it and took a bus to Hamilton.

So this is just a documentation of my little holiday.
These were taken over quite a few days.
A line is drawn to divide each day.

<hr/>
Stayed at Hamilton across Christmas.
There was absolutely nothing to do here, and everything that can be done was closed anyway.
After resting for quite a long time I went to the Gardens to take a look.
It was supposed to be world famous and had won a few awards, and I would say that it lives up to that name.

Went to Rotorua after that because my legs were still useless.
That walk in the Gardens were pushing my limits already.
Rotorua is a geothermal zone so it's quite cool and smelly.

Went mountain biking at the redwood forests near Rotorua.
Its a pretty well established track with all Grades 1-5 I think.
Didn't see a Grade 6 there but I think they have it there?

Anyway managed to do a Grade 4, but mostly stayed at Grade 3.
Was pretty fun.

More Rotorua. There's a lot more to see here than at Hamilton.
Here are just some lakes and parks around town:
