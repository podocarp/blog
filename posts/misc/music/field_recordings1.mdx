During my [Te Araroa trip](/posts/outdoors/araroa/sum), I brought my Tascam with
me. I anticipated the need to record not just pictures, but also the sounds of
the foreign and wonderful climes I visited. After all this while I have finally
got around to processing everything, and you can listen to the result on the
right. Feel free to download them (lossless available if you're into that).

I must admit, I am not quite an expert in making field recordings. A lot of time
was spent editing out mistakes that could have been avoided during recording.
Furthermore, availability of recording subjects was also rare and hard to come
by, and many times they were obscured by background noise that I knew I would
never want to try and remove from the recordings. That explains why only such a
low quantity of recordings are available after 3 months of recording.
