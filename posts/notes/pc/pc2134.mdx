Just finished a test, my solutions are attached. The test was 90 minutes long,
but well, I took a whole day typing this out. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` Topics tested were
(checked means it appeared):

- [ ] Fourier Series
- [x] Fourier Transform
- [x] Laplace Transform
- [ ] Dirac Delta Functiion
- [x] Second Order ODE (Frobenius)
- [ ] Sturm Louville
- [ ] Baby Green's Function

The lecturer is not in the habit of uploading solutions and I guess it will do
no harm if I put mine up.

## Help sheet

We could bring in a A4 sized help sheet. Here is mine. May it serve you well.
