## Extra questions

1. The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is
   a zero-player game and is a kind of cellular automaton. It has an infinite 2D
   grid of _cells_.. Each cell has two states --- alive or dead. They evolve
   (change states) based on a fixed set of rules every generation (time step).
   Here are the rules:

   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours die (under-population).
   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remain alive.
   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours die (over-population).
   - Any dead cell with three live neighbours become a live cell (reproduction).

   The grid of cells can be represented as a 2D array of numbers. A value of `0`
   represents a dead cell and `1` represents a live cell.

   - First, write a function `init_board(rows, cols)` that takes in two natural
     numbers `rows` and `cols`, and generates a 2D array with `rows` number of
     rows and `cols` number of columns. All cells are initially dead.

   - Next, perhaps the universe is actually finite in size. Perhaps spacetime
     closes in on itself. Think of arcade games: going off the screen brings you
     to the other side. Write a function `live_neighbours(grid, n, r, c)`
     that takes in as parameters a 2D `n` by `n` array `grid`, natural numbers
     `n`, `r`, `c`, and returns the number of live neighbours the cell
     `grid[r][c]` has. Be sure to keep in mind the geometry of our spacetime. You
     may assume `n >= 3`.

   - Finally, you should create a function `next(grid, n)` that takes in a 2D `n`
     by `n` array `grid`, and returns the array but updated with the next
     generation state of all cells. Again, `n >= 3`. What is the order of growth
     of your function `next`?

2. There are flies on a wall. A lizard wants to eat flies. It starts at the top
   of the wall, moves one tile down (the wall is made of tiles), eats the fly on
   the tile (if any), moves one tile down, and so on, until it reaches the
   floor. It can move in this manner:

   ```text
    +----+----+----+
    |    |    |    |
    |    | L  |    |
    +--------------+
    |    |    |    |
    | L' | L' | L' |
    +----+----+----+
   ```

   where the lizard moves from an initial position `L` to a one of the new
   positions `L'`.

   Write a function `max_flies(tiles)` where `tiles` is a 2D array where
   `tile_flies[r][c]` represents the number of flies on the tile located at row
   `r` and column `c` on the wall. The function returns the maximum possible
   number of flies the lizard can eat in one single trip from the top of the
   wall to the bottom of the wall moving with the rules detailed above.

   ```js
   const tiles = [
     [3, 1, 7, 4, 2],
     [2, 1, 3, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, 2, 1, 8],
     [2, 2, 1, 5, 3],
     [2, 1, 4, 4, 4],
     [5, 7, 2, 5, 1],
   ];
   max_flies(tiles); // result: 32
   ```

   Try using memoization in your answer. How fast is a memoized vs a
   non-memoized version of your answer?

   **Extra challenge**: Can you modify your function to print out the path
   the lizard would have taken?

3. A severe flood has broken out at a river. You are tasked with mapping out
   flooded regions and non flooded regions. Given the topology of the land
   predicted height of flood water, we can predict which regions will be
   flooded.

   - The flood is known to have started at a specific position on the map.
   - Water only flows north, south, east, west one tile at a time.
   - Water will only flood into lands that are lower than the water level.
   - Water cannot "jump" across land barriers, i.e. the flood can create a lake,
     but it will not overflow as long as its borders are high enough.

   Write a function `floodfill(map, h, s_x, s_y)` that takes in a `map`
   representing the map, height of the flood water `h`, and starting coordinates
   of the flood, `s_x` and `s_y`. The map is a 2D array where `map[x][y]`
   represents the height of the land at coordinates `(x, y)`. Your function
   should return an updated array with flooded regions marked with symbol `~`
   and the rest untouched. Example:

   ```js
   const m = [
     [3, 1, 7, 4, 2],
     [2, 5, 3, 1, 2],
     [1, 3, 2, 1, 8],
     [3, 2, 1, 5, 3],
     [2, 1, 4, 4, 4],
     [5, 7, 4, 5, 1],
   ];
   floodfill(m, 3, 2, 3);
   /* m afterwards:
   [[3, 1, 7, 4, "~"],
    [2, 5, 3, "~", "~"],
    [1, 3, "~", "~", 8],
    [3, "~", "~", 5, 3],
    ["~", "~", 4, 4, 4],
    [5, 7, 4, 5, 1]] */
   ```

4. We can represent a matrix as a 2D array of numbers. For example:

   ```text
   ( 1  2 )
   ( 3  4 )

   [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
   ```

   Write a function `mrotate_cw(M)` that takes in a matrix `M` and rotates
   it 90 degrees clockwise. For example:

   ```text
   [[ 1, 2,  3,  4],
    [ 5, 6,  7,  8],
    [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]]
   Becomes
   [[13, 9,  5, 1],
    [14, 10, 6, 2],
    [15, 11, 7, 3],
    [16, 12, 8, 4]]
   ```

   The challenge is that the rotation must be performed in-place. This means
   that you cannot create any additional data structures.

## Answers

1. This is just for fun and is quite easy so no answers provided.
2. First we have to note that this cannot be solved by simply taking the best
   choice at every turn. Using the example from just now:

   ```text
   [[3,1,7,4,2],
    [2,1,3,1,1],
    [1,2,2,1,8],
    [2,2,1,5,3],
    [2,1,4,4,4],
    [5,7,2,5,1]];

    Greedy path 1: 7+3+2+2+2+5 = 21
    Greedy path 2: 7+3+2+5+4+5 = 26
   ```

   So we need to actually consider all possibilities. Let us use some wishful
   thinking here. If the wall is just 1 tile tall, that would be easily solved
   --- we just take the maximum. What if the wall is 2 tiles tall? We would, at
   every starting tile, ask the 3 tiles we can move to: "who is the max?". After
   that, we would ask all the starting tiles: "who is the max?". Then that tile
   is the winner.

   To put it more formally, at every tile, we would record this down:

   ```js
   tiles[x][y] +
     max(max_flies(x - 1, y + 1), max_flies(x, y + 1), max_flies(x + 1, y + 1));
   ```

   which is the maximum number of flies we can possibly eat if we pretend to
   have started from this tile. Then to know what is the actual answer we just
   call `max` on `max_flies(0, 0)` to `max_flies(cols - 1, 0)`. Which are the
   actual starting tiles.

   So here is the entire implementation together with helper functions and all.

   ```js
   function max_flies(tiles) {
     const rows = array_length(tiles);
     const cols = array_length(tiles[0]); //assume its not jagged

     /* returns true if coords are in bounds */
     function bound_check(x, y) {
       return !(x < 0 || x > cols - 1 || y < 0 || y > rows - 1);
     }

     /* gets the number of flies at (c, r) */
     function get_flies(c, r) {
       return bound_check(c, r) ? tiles[r][c] : undefined;
     }

     const memo = [];
     memo[rows - 1] = tiles[rows - 1];

     function read(x, y) {
       return bound_check(x, y)
         ? memo[y] === undefined
           ? undefined
           : memo[y][x]
         : undefined;
     }
     function write(x, y, v) {
       if (!bound_check(x, y)) {
         return undefined;
       } else if (memo[x] === undefined) {
         memo[y] = [];
       } else {
       }
       memo[y][x] = v;
     }

     function max_flies_start(x, y) {
       const readout = read(x, y);
       if (readout !== undefined) {
         return readout;
       } else if (!bound_check(x, y)) {
         return 0;
       } else {
         const res =
           get_flies(x, y) +
           max(
             list(
               max_flies_start(x - 1, y + 1),
               max_flies_start(x, y + 1),
               max_flies_start(x + 1, y + 1)
             )
           );
         write(x, y, res);
         return res;
       }
     }

     return max(map((x) => max_flies_start(x, 0), enum_list(0, cols - 1)));
   }

   function max(xs) {
     return accumulate((x, acc) => (x > acc ? x : acc), 0, xs);
   }
   ```

   How would you return the optimal path that the algorithm has found? This is
   actually more tedious than it is hard. What you can do is to modify
   `max_flies_start` to return a pair of `(res, path)` where `res` stays the
   same, but `path` is now a list of optimal visited tiles. Of course `max`
   would have to be modified as well.

   Congratulations, you have just written [depth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).

3. This is a fairly easy recursion problem.

   ```js
   function floodfill(m, h, s_x, s_y) {
     const rows = array_length(m);
     const cols = array_length(m[0]);

     function bound_check(x, y) {
       return !(x < 0 || x > cols - 1 || y < 0 || y > rows - 1);
     }

     function neighbours(x, y) {
       const candidates = list(
         pair(x - 1, y),
         pair(x + 1, y),
         pair(x, y - 1),
         pair(x, y + 1)
       );
       return filter((x) => bound_check(head(x), tail(x)), candidates);
     }
     if (m[s_y][s_x] === "~") {
       return undefined;
     } else if (m[s_y][s_x] < h) {
       m[s_y][s_x] = "~";
       map((x) => floodfill(m, h, head(x), tail(x)), neighbours(s_x, s_y));
     } else {
     }
   }
   ```

   Congratulations, you have just written a modified [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill).

4. Transpose the matrix then reverse each row. Exercise left for the reader.
