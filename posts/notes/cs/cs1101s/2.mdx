Welcome onboard CS1101S! This will likely be your first contact with computing.
Our goal is to make this process enriching and educational. Hopefully by the end
of this course you will have a better understanding of computing. The goal is
for you to realise --- computing is not just programming! A million monkeys can
write Shakespeare, but we do not call them Shakespeare.

In any case, on each week's page there will be two sets of slides. One set is
the "view" set, with transitions and is what I use for presentation. You can use
this to follow with my presentation, but is largely unnecessary. The second set
is the "handout" set, with very detailed annotations.

At the bottom of every page is a comments section. You are encouraged to use
this to attach solutions to studio questions, answer some exercises in the
slides, or ask questions about the tutorial in general.
