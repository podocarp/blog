## Mastery check (2021)

These are the updated questions for this semester. Past year questions and
answers are left below for reference.

### Scope

1. Are function parameters considered to be name declarations? Otherwise, what
   are they?
2. Determine the output of the following program and describe how you arrived at
   the answer:

   ```js
   function g(g) {
     return (g) => g(g);
   }

   g((f) => f(f))((g) => (f) => f(g))(display);
   ```

### Higher order functions

3. Discuss what you understand by ``higher order functions'' and why it is an
   useful thing to have.
4. Recall we mentioned in class that `accumulate` is also known as fold right
   since the function application starts from the right side of the list.
   Implement fold left.
   ```js
   f(0 ... f(n-1, f(n, init)))            // fold right
   f(f(f(init, 0), 1), 2 ...)             // fold left
   ```
   As a bonus, try and see if you can implement fold right using fold left.

### Substitution model

5. If you are given a recursive process, can you always transform it into an
   iterative process? If yes, how? If no, why not?
   Hint: <span class="spoiler">Think about storing answers as
   parameters.</span><br/>

## Mastery check (2020)

Write up your answers briefly in the comment sections below. Feel free to
discuss and cross reference.

### Scope

1. What is the difference between a name declaration and name occurrence?
2. What are the 4 kinds of name declarations in Source?
3. Are function parameters declarations?
4. Consider the following. Does it work? If it does, explain what it does. If it
   doesn't then explain why.
   ```js
   function twice(g) {
     return (y) => g(g(x));
   }
   f((y) => x * x);
   ```

### Higher order functions

5. Give the signature for function `concatMap`.
   `js
    function concatMap(f) {
        return xs => accumulate((a, b) => append(f(a), b), null, xs);
    }
    `
   If you need a hint, try the second question first.

6. Consider the following. What does it do? Please try this first instead of
   simply running it. It will do you good.
   ```js
   (n) =>
     concatMap((x) => map((y) => list(x, y, x * y), enum_list(1, x)))(
       enum_list(1, n)
     );
   ```

### Substitution model

7. Try the above for `n = 2`. Again, try to do this without relying on the
   interpreter. You can skip a few steps if it is obvious what is going to
   happen.

## Extra questions

Some questions are more difficult than others. In general these are for you to
practice, have fun, and learn new things. It may not be entirely reflective of
the difficulty or content of the midterms.

### 1. Optimus Prime

A prime is a number that has exactly 2 distinct factors. Examples are 2, 3, 5,
7, 11. This question will guide you through generating a list of primes.

- Write a function `sieve(xs)` using `filter` that takes in list `xs`, and
  returns another list but without their multiples.
- Write a function `primes(a, b)` that will generate all primes between
  integers `a` and `b`, where `a < b`.
- How many primes are there between 1101 and 2020?
- What is the time complexity of your implementation of `primes`? Give it in
  terms of `a` and `b`.

### 2. Queue up

A queue is a data structure. Just like a real queue, the first person to go in
is also the first one to come out. This is known as first in first out (FIFO).

A queue structure has 3 defining features:

- $O(1)$ `enqueue(x)` --- queues `x` up and returns the new queue.
- $O(1)$ `dequeue` --- removes the next in line from the queue and returns a
  pair of the new queue and the item removed.

This is all fairly easy to do if you have another data structure called a doubly
linked list. In Source, `list` is what is known as a _singly_ linked list. If
you draw a box and pointer diagram, you can follow the arrows in only one
direction. This means appending takes $O(n)$ time while prepending takes
$O(1)$ time. Well we do not have this feature in Source. Try and figure out a
way to do this anyway?

Hint: You can do this with 2 lists. Try making a $O(n)$ `dequeue` first. Then
try to make it $O(1)$ "on average". This means for example if we `dequeue` $n$
items, then it still takes $O(n)$ operations. This is entirely possible if only
the first few operations are costly and the rest are cheap. To give you an
illustration, consider doubling the length of a list of length $n$ by adding
some junk to the end. This is actually $O(1)$ on average, despite the append
operation taking $O(n)$ time, because only one append is required.

More hints: If you still have some trouble, consider <span
style="background:black; color:black;"> having a list facing the front and
another facing the back. </span>

Even more hints: yes, this question might be quite difficult at this level.
Don't worry. Have you considered using <span style="background:black; color:
black;">reverse</span> somewhere?

### 3. Select-k

Given an **unsorted** list of numbers. Find the $k$-th largest element as fast
as you can.

Hint: Take some inspiration from <span style="background:black;
color:black;">quicksort</span>.

### 4. Palindromes

A palindrome is a string where it is the same regardless of if you read it left
to right or right to left. For example (ignore spaces, capitalization, and
punctuation):

```text
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama
```

This is a famous palindrome referring to the Panama Canal.

Write a function `isPalindrome(xs)` that takes in a string represented as a list
of characters `xs` (guaranteed to have no spaces, capitalization, or
punctuation), and returns `true` iff it is a palindrome.

What is the time and space complexity of your algorithm? Can you find a linear
time solution?

### 5. Laziness

Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy where an expression is evaluated only
at the last minute. Source does not use lazy evaluation. However, there is a way
to mimic this effect using _closures_. The trick here is to use the fact that a
function can "capture" some variables. Consider

```js
function pair(x, y) {
  return (f) => f(x, y);
}
```

Now we have information regarding `x` and `y` that has been locked into the
anonymous function returned by `pair`, and can utilize it sometime later.

Now consider something even simpler:

```js
const x = 1 + 1;
() => x + 1;
```

What is the purpose of this? Notice that `x` will be bound to `2` because it is
eagerly evaluated. However, the function body will not be evaluated to `3` until
it is called.

Now take a look at this:

```js
const ones = pair(1, () => ones);

function dtail(p) {
  return tail(p)();
}
```

What do you think this is? Try

```js
head(ones);
head(dtail(ones));
head(dtail(dtail(ones)));
```

and so on.

### 6. Accumulation

`accumulate` is also known as "fold-right" since we perform the accumulation
starting from the right side of the list. There is also an analogue "fold-left"
where we start from the left side of the list.

```js
f(0 ... f(n-1, f(n, init)))            // fold right
f(f(f(init, 0), 1), 2 ...)             // fold left
```

Implement `accumulatel`, which folds from the left, using `accumulate`. Do not
use `reverse` (that would be too easy).

Hint: Use the idea from question 5 and use functions intelligently to delay the
accumulation.

## Answers

### Mastery check questions

5. First we have to be clear what is the type of `f` to begin with. It has type
   `a -> list`. This can be inferred from the initial value of `accumulate`.
   Therefore `concatMap` has a full signature of

   ```text
   (a -> list) -> list -> list
   ```

6. Looking at the signature of `concatMap` we can deduce its behaviour. It can
   be thought of as `map`ping a function `f` first. `map` with `f` will create a
   list of lists. Then this result is flattened.

   Looking at this function here, we take in a parameter `n`. The function is

   ```js
   (x) => map((y) => list(x, y, x * y), enum_list(1, x));
   ```

   This takes in some number `x` and creates `list(1, 2, ..., x)`. Now to each
   element in this list, `map` will create `list(x, 1, x)`, `list(x, 2, 2x)`,
   and so on.

   If you look at this for some time you see that all it is doing is creating
   the multiplication table.

### Extra questions

1. This algorithm is known as the [Sieve of
   Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). Note that
   the Wikipedia link shows a different implementation. You can try to implement
   that version as well. It would be faster since it does not check every
   element each run, only the multiples.

   ```js
   function sieve(xs) {
       if (is_null(xs)) {
           return null;
       } else {
           const x = head(xs);
           pair(x, sieve(filter(y => y % x !== 0, tail(xs))));
       }

   function primes(a, b) {
       const xs = sieve(enum_list(2, b));
       return filter(x => x >= a, xs);
   }
   ```

   Note that `filter` runs in time `$O(n)$`. Then looking at `sieve`, it runs
   `filter` for every item, and this means the overall complexity is `$O(n^2)$`.
   You would be correct if you answered this, although this bound is not tight.

   The implementation by Wikipedia is easier to analyse. This is because they
   only check multiples at each run, and not every number. Hence the work done
   each time is exactly $\frac{n}{p_k}$.

2. The limitations make this hard. But the limitations are imposed because we
   lack mutability. In the upcoming weeks, once we have mutability implementing
   a queue will become very easy.

   ```js
   // a queue is a pair of the enqueuing list and the dequeuing list.
   function queue() {
     return pair(null, null);
   }

   function enqueue(x, q) {
     const enlist = head(q);
     const delist = tail(q);
     return pair(pair(x, enlist), delist);
   }

   function dequeue(q) {
     const enlist = head(q);
     const delist = tail(q);
     if (is_null(enlist)) {
       return null;
     } else if (is_null(delist)) {
       return dequeue(pair(enlist, reverse(enlist)));
     } else {
       // pair of the dequeued item and the new queue.
       return pair(head(delist), pair(enlist, tail(delist)));
     }
   }
   ```

3. The simplest solution would be to just sort the list and take the $k$-th
   element. That would take time $O(n \log n + k)$. However there is a way to
   get $O(n)$.

   Take any element and put all those smaller than it in one list,
   and all those not smaller than it in another. The $k$-th largest element is
   either the element, in the left list, or in the right list. Depending on the
   sizes of the two lists we can decide this fact.

   ```js
   function selectk(xs, k) {
     if (is_null(xs)) {
       return null;
     } else {
     }

     const pivot = head(xs);
     const left = filter((x) => x < pivot, tail(xs));
     const right = filter((x) => x >= pivot, tail(xs));
     const llen = length(left);
     const rlen = length(right);

     if (llen === k - 1) {
       return pivot;
     } else if (llen > k - 1) {
       return selectk(left, k);
     } else {
       return selectk(right, k - llen - 1);
     }
   }
   ```

   The complexity of this is a difficult question at this level, because it
   changes depending on the list `xs`. You can see that if `xs` is completely
   sorted, then the time complexity will be $O(kn)$. When it is completely
   unsorted then we need some probability theory to give the bounds. This
   method does not give any improvements because the pivot is fixed at the
   first element and the worst case will always be $O(kn)$. Is this good? Is
   this better than $O(n \log n)$? No, because for example if we want to select
   the median, then $k = \frac{n}{2}$ and this becomes quadratic time.

   The fix is to select the pivot intelligently. There are two options here.
   The first is we just pick a random pivot each time. The second is to be able
   to guess at the median element. Both of these methods are our best effort at
   trying to halve the list each pass. If we manage to exactly halve the list
   each time, then we will finish in time $O(n)$ regardless of $k$ (can you
   show why this is the case?).

   Unfortunately there is no way to do this in Source right now, because we do
   not have random access. This means `list_ref` takes linear time. When arrays
   are introduced this will be possible, because we can access the pivot in
   constant time.

4. Just check `equal` on `xs` and `reverse(xs)`.

5. It creates an infinite list!

6. Again:

   ```js
   f(0, f(1, f(2, ... f(k, init)  // fold right
   f(f(f(init, 0), 1)...          // fold left
   ```

   Looking at this, we note that is there was a way for each `f` to know what
   was the element before it, then we could perhaps solve this problem. We
   could perhaps come up with something like this:

   ```js
   // if we convert f(init, f(0, ... into
   (n => ...(f(n, 0))) (init)
   // where ... = n => ...(f(n, 1))
   ```

   Will this work? Let us try evaluating a few steps

   ```js
   (n => ...(f(n, 0))) (init)
   ...(f(init, 0))
   ...(f(f(init, 0), 1))

   ```

   Yes it does!

   ```js
   function accumulatel(f, init, xs) {
     return accumulate(
       (x, d) => (n) => d(f(n, x)),
       (x) => x,
       xs
     )(init);
   }
   ```
