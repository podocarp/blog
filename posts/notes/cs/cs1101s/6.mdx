Extra questions:

1. Implement a `set` data structure using lists. A `set` is an unordered
   collection of unique items. You will need to implement the following
   functions:

   - `set(xs)` returns a new set containing elements in list `xs`.
   - `add(s, x)` add item `x` to set `s` and return the new set.
   - `is_elem(x, x)` checks if `x` is in `s`.
   - `union(s1, s2)` return a new set that contains all the elements in `s1`
     and `s2`.
   - `intersect(s1, s2)` return a new set that contains elements in both `s1`
     and `s2`.

   It does not matter how you back up your data structure, but try to pick the
   most reasonable!

2. The function `accumulate_n` is similar to `accumulate` except that it takes
   as its third argument a list of lists, which are all assumed to have the same
   number of elements. It applies the designated accumulation function to
   combine all the first elements of the sequences, all the second elements of
   the sequences, and so on, and returns a list of the results. For example:

   ```js
   const s = list(
     list(1, 2, 3),
     list(4, 5, 6),
     list(7, 8, 9),
     list(10, 11, 12)
   );
   // returns list(22, 26, 30).
   accumulate_n((x, y) => x + y, 0, s);
   ```

   If you want a hint, here is a skeleton:

   ```js
    function accumulate_n(op, init, seqs) {
        return is_null(head(seqs))
            ? null
            : pair( ..., ...);
    }
   ```

3. [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) is a sorting
   method that revolves around the `insert` function. What insertion sort does
   is to basically take one element, and insert it at the correct place in a
   list.

   ```text
    insert(4, xs) ────┐
                      v
            xs = 1  3  5  9
   ```

   - Implement `insert`. You can use whatever ordering you like.
   - Implement `insertionsort` using your `insert` function.
   - Give the space and time complexity for your implementation.
